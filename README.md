# Geometrical visualizations

Visualize integer sequences and other mathematically-defined objects in your browser!
[You can see it live here!](http://shadamethyst.xyz:8420/)

This small project aims to provide entertaining and interesting geometrical visualizations of common mathematical objects, like sequences, matrices, etc.
The interface lets the user select which sequence/matrix/etc. is visualized, the visualization method used and tweak several of their parameters.

The included backend uses `Node.js`, which serves a simple website.
The website can be used statically as well.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Jacob Yatsko's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1eLKODSCqw) on visualizing the Fibonacci sequence with moduli.

## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots of my favorite pictures generated by the website:

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/adri326/geometrical-visualizations
cd geometrical-visualizations
npm i
cp settings.json.sample settings.json
```

You should then edit `settings.json` to fit your needs.

## Usage

Simply run the server with:

```
node .
```

The server will then be listening on the port specified in `settings.json` (8080 by default).
If you are running it on your machine, then you can navigate to `localhost:8080` (or the port that you set in `settings.json`) and start fiddling.

## Performance

Javascript's `BigInt`s are used in this app, and some visualizators may start querying a lot of values, depending on their parameters.
It can thus take a few seconds to visualize it.

Sequences are cached, as to not re-generate their terms when not needed.
